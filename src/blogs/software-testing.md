# Software Testing

## The test is more important than the unit

The pupil asked the great master programmer Flying Feathers:

“What makes a test a unit test?”
This great master programmer answered:

“If it talks to the database, it is not a unit test.

If it communicates across the network, it is not a unit test.

If it touches the file system, it is not a unit test.

If it can’t run at the same time as any other unit tests, it is not a unit test.

If you have to do special things to your environment to run it, it is not a unit test.”

Other master programmers, hearing this conversation, jumped in with dissenting opinions and started to argue loudly.

“Sorry I asked”, said the pupil said the pupil as he left. Later that night, he received a note from the great grand master programmer:

“The answer from the great master Flying Feathers is an excellent guide. If you follow it most of the time you will do well. But don’t get stuck on any dogma. Write the test that needs to be written.”
The pupil slept well. The other masters continued to argue long into the night.
