# In today's digital era, APIs have become the backbone of many services we use daily.

Whether it's fetching data from a weather app, making a payment through an online service, or streaming music, there's an API working behind the scenes. This underscores the importance of having an efficient and robust API management system in place, especially in an age where microservices are highly prevalent.

## Introducing the API Gateway.

At its essence, an API Gateway is akin to a traffic conductor or doorkeeper for digital applications. It stands as the layer between external users or devices and the backend services, handling request proxying, composition, and protocol translation, acting as a `reverse proxy`.

Within the realm of microservices, the relevance of API Gateway cannot be overstated. As applications evolve and become more fragmented into distinct services, managing and ensuring smooth communication between these services becomes an increasingly complex task. The API Gateway consolidates these numerous, often complex interactions into a singular point, thereby streamlining requests and responses. It provides an organized layer, and is able to centralise policies such as rate limiting, authorization/authentication, and load balancing.

But why is there a buzz around API Gateways now? The reason is the explosion in the number of devices, ranging from mobile phones to IoT devices to enterprise business servers, all making requests. The diverse nature of these requests, in terms of data formats, protocols, and functions, demands a versatile and robust system to manage them. Enter the API Gateway, a solution that not only simplifies the backend complexities but also optimizes user experience by ensuring swift, secure, and efficient data delivery.

## The Tradeoffs of API Gateway Pattern

Now that you have a brief understanding of why we use API Gateways, let's discuss some of benefits and drawbacks of the API Gateway Pattern! (diagram made by excalidraw btw. Best diagramming software I've used to date!)

### Benefits of the API Gateway Pattern

- **Centralized Location (Simplified Client):** An API Gateway offers a unified access point for all external consumers, which means clients can interact with a single endpoint rather than managing multiple service endpoints. This simplifies the client's configuration drastically.
- **Encapsulation of Private APIs:** The gateway can hide certain APIs from public exposure as seen in the diagram above. This way, internal services can encapsulated within their own private network, leaving only the API Gateway to be exposed to the public network.
- **Authentication:** API Gateways can centralize authentication, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access backend services. By centralizing this function, uniform security policies can be applied across all services.
- **Whitelisting and Blacklisting:** API Gateways can centralize authentication, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access backend services. By centralizing this function, uniform security policies can be applied across all services.
- **Rate Limiting:** To protect services from being overwhelmed by requests, the gateway can limit the number of requests a client or user can make within a specified time. This can help prevent hacking attempts such as DDOS (Denial of Service) attacks.
- **Analytics and Logging:** By channeling all requests and responses through the gateway, it becomes easier to gather data and monitor how the APIs are being used.
- **Load Balancing:** The gateway can distribute incoming traffic among multiple service instances, ensuring that no single instance gets overwhelmed. This contributes to both system resilience and optimal resource utilization.

### Some of the tradeoffs (drawbacks)

- **Increased Latency:** Introducing an API Gateway means adding another layer through which traffic must pass, resulting in an additional network hop. This will add additional latency to the request response lifecycle.
- **High Risk - Central Point of Failure:** If the gateway crashes or becomes unresponsive, it can disrupt access to all the services behind it. Properly setting up redundancies, failovers, and monitoring becomes absolutely crucial.
- **Increased Complexity:** Managing an API Gateway involves several tasks, including setting up routes, managing security policies, and orchestrating service requests. Onboarding new APIs or decommissioning old ones can also introduce administrative and organizational overhead.

## Building an API Gateway Miniseries

Given the rising importance of APIs in our digital ecosystem, understanding the how API gateways function is crucial. This is why I'll be dedicating a mini-series to guide you through building your own lightweight API gateway. I'll attempt to create my own personal API Gateway using the Golang language to learn more about API Gateways as well as pick up this new programming language, and you can follow along as well! So, stay tuned!
